# bIT-SHifT
I've created bIT-SHifT - a fully functional 3D exploration game that demonstrates the evolution of graphics through different "bit" eras! Here's what the game features:

## Key Features Implemented:
- ðŸŽ® 3D Exploration: Navigate a minimalist 3D world with platforms and obstacles
- ðŸŽ¨ Dynamic Graphics Shifting: Visual style evolves from 8-bit to 128-bit as you progress
- âœ¨ Smooth Transitions: Tween.js powers seamless material and lighting changes
- ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Checkpoints: Glowing octahedral portals trigger evolution
- ðŸ“± Cross-Platform Controls: WASD/Arrow keys + mobile touch controls
- ðŸŽ¨ Progressive Enhancement: Each bit level has unique materials, colors, and fog

## Bit Level Progression:
- 8-bit: Flat colors, retro pixel aesthetic
- 16-bit: Enhanced colors with basic Lambert shading
- 32-bit: Standard PBR materials with basic lighting
- 64-bit: Realistic materials with enhanced properties
- 128-bit: Photorealistic materials with advanced lighting

## How to Play:
- Use WASD/Arrow keys to move (or touch controls on mobile)
- Spacebar/Jump button to jump between platforms
- Find and touch the glowing checkpoints to evolve graphics

## Experience the visual journey through gaming history!
The game uses procedurally generated materials and colors (no external textures needed), making it fully self-contained while still delivering the core experience of witnessing graphics evolution in real-time!
